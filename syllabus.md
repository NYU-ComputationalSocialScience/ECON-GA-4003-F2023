# Syllabus: Data Skills for CSS

## ECON-GA 4003

This course teaches the foundational skills necessary to do modern data
analytics using the Python programming language. We assume that students
have previously worked with Python. We will add to existing Python
skills and teach the core scientific and data-specific libraries (numpy,
scipy, matplotlib, and pandas). We will use these skills to analyze a
variety of social science datasets and answer research and business
questions.

### About the instructors

This course is co-taught by three instructors: Chase Coleman
(cgc332@nyu.edu), Spencer Lyon (sgl290@nyu.edu), and Thomas Sargent
(ts43@nyu.edu).

Office hours: By appointment

### Where and When

Meeting times: Tuesday 6:00 pm - 8:50 pm (Eastern Standard Time)

Meeting place: gather.town -- See brightspace for the link to join class

## Requirements

Students should have prior experience using the Python programming
language before starting this course. Ideally, students will have
completed the Summer "Pre-Course" that teaches these skills. Throughout
this course we will leverage programming skills such as control flow
constructs (`if/else`, `for/while`), defining custom functions (`def`),
and finding help on existing functions (`?` in Jupyter environments and
`help` elsewhere).

Althoughy a course in probability or statistics is not a prerequisite,
students will find some knowledge of these topics to be helpful.

Students are required to have access to a personal computer (laptop)
that can be brought with them to lectures. Computers will be used by
students in each class session and those without a laptop will not get
the necessary in-class practice in order to master the concepts we
study.

## Course Objectives

The key objective in this course is for students to use Python to do
meaningful data analysis using social science data sets. Success in this
course can be described as the studentâ€™s ability to do the following:

- Read, write, and understand basic programs written in the Python
  programming language

- Import, clean, combine, and summarize datasets from a variety of
  sources

- Construct informative visualizations of raw data and model results

- Implement basic data engineering best practices such as optimizing
  organization and structure of datasets, using effective storage
  formats for a given task, and automating repetitive
  extract-transform-load (ETL) processes

## Getting help

This course is meant to be collaborative and to have a strong support
system to help you when you run into problems. Please use the discussion
board or other forms of communication to communicate with your
classmates and ask questions/help each other.

The bottom line: **If you're stuck, ask for help**.

Really. Don't be a hero, ask for help.

## Course materials and assignments

All course materials will be posted here on Jupyteach

## Deliverables and grades

Graded work includes:

- **Course participation.** We expect students to participate in
  class. If you have questions, don't be shy about asking them. The
  discussion forums are a great place to participate in class as well.

- **Code Practice.** There will be several homework assignments
  throughout the semester. We encourage you do to all of them (they're
  good practice) but your lowest grade will dropped. We find that
  people who finish these assignments tend to keep up with the
  material better and these are easy points to get in terms of grades.

- **Quizzes.** There will be a quiz most days that we have class.
  These quizzes should take between 5 and 10 minutes and will test
  general Python knowledge and review material from the previous
  class.

- **Exams.** There will be two exams. These exams will be take home
  and you may use your notes and the internet. The only exception is
  that we'd ask that you don't ask the exam questions in online forums
  and that you don't speak with your classmates about the exam.

- **Project.** The main deliverable for the semester will be a
  project. We will discuss what this project entails in a separate
  document.

**Due dates** will be communicated clearly on Jupyteach.

**Dates are not negotiable. Anything handed in late will get a grade of
zero.**

**All your work should be clean and professional.** We expect your math
to be written in LaTeX for this course and expect your code to conform
to good code habits.

**Final grades** will be computed from

|                                 |     |
|:--------------------------------|:----|
| Participation / Professionalism | 5%  |
| Code practice                   | 15% |
| Quizzes                         | 15% |
| Exams                           | 25% |
| Project                         | 40% |

## Recommended work habits

Python is not something you can learn from reading a book and attending
lectures. You need to **write programs**\... The more the better. Think
about how you'd learn to play basketball or soccer; reading and
listening to lectures aren't enough, you need to do it. We'll do a lot
of programming in class, but it's essential that you follow up outside
of class.

## Pacing

The course is designed to be cover material at whatever pace the class
is capable of. The topics should take roughly one week each, but we can
scale that up or down as needed. If you're an expert, don't worry, we'll
cover a lot of material either way.

## Other questions

We encourage students who have questions to typically post their
questions on the Brightspace site so that answers can be referenced by
other students. If no answer is provided in a reasonable amount of time
(i.e. wait at least 24 hours), you may email us to remind us of the
question. If you have a question about a matter that should be kept
private, please don't hesitate to reach out directly by email.

## Schedule and weekly learning goals

The schedule is tentative and subject to change. Several of the modules
below will occupy more than one week. The learning goals target key
concepts to be mastered after each module. Successive modules build on
early modules.

## Policies

- **General Behavior.** The School expects that students will conduct
  themselves with respect and professionalism toward faculty,
  students, and others present in class and will follow the rules laid
  down by the instructor for classroom behavior. Students who fail to
  do so may be asked to leave the classroom.

- **Collaboration on Graded Assignments.** You may discuss assignments
  with anyone (in fact, we encourage it), but anything you submit,
  including your code, should be your own. Exams should be entirely
  your own work. Violation of this policy will result in a failing
  grade for the course.

- **Academic Integrity.**
  - Integrity is critical to the learning process and to all that we
    do here at NYU. As members of our community, all students agree
    to abide by the NYU Student Code of Conduct, which includes a
    commitment to:
  - Exercise integrity in all aspects of one's academic work
    including, but not limited to, the preparation and completion of
    exams, papers and all other course requirements by not engaging
    in any method or means that provides an unfair advantage.
  - Clearly acknowledge the work and efforts of others when
    submitting written work as one's own. Ideas, data, direct
    quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks),
    paraphrasing, creative expression, or any other incorporation of
    the work of others should be fully referenced.
  - Refrain from behaving in ways that knowingly support, assist, or
    in any way attempt to enable another person to engage in any
    violation of the Code of Conduct. Our support also includes
    reporting any observed violations of this Code of Conduct or
    other School and University policies that are deemed to
    adversely affect the NYU community.

The entire Student [Code of
Conduct](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/compliance/code-of-ethical-conduct.html)
applies to all students enrolled in NYU courses. **Any violation of
the a policies pertaining to Academic Integrity will result in a
failing grade for the course.**

### Students with disabilities

If you have a qualified disability that requires academic accommodation
during this course, please contact the Moses Center for Students with
Disabilities (CSD, 212-998-4980) and ask them to send me a letter
verifying your registration and outlining the accommodation they
